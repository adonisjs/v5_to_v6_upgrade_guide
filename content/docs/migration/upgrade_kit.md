# Migration guide

In this guide we gonna cover everything you need to know to migrate your AdonisJS v5 application to v6. First, let's introduce the `upgrade-kit` CLI tool.

## Upgrade Kit

The `Upgrade Kit` is a CLI tool that will help you migrate your AdonisJS v5 application to v6. It is built on using `ts-morph` so it is able to parse and modify your Typescript files directly. It probably won't be cover all the work needed to migrate your application, but it will take care of the most tedious and boring parts.

The upgrade kit has multiples patches that **must be applied in a specific order**. After executing a patch, **make sure to review the changes**, commit them, and then execute the next patch.

Some codemods are difficult to write perfectly, because we have to take into account a lot of different cases of writing code. So, it is possible that some patches will not be able to migrate your code correctly. In this case, you can always fix the code manually, by following the the instructions for each patch just below. Otherwise, feel free to also open an issue on the [Upgrade Kit repository](https://github.com/adonisjs/upgrade-kit) and we will try to fix it as soon as possible.

## Installation

First you need to install the upgrade kit globally :

:::codegroup

```sh
// title: npm
npm i -g @adonisjs/upgrade-kit
```

```sh
// title: pnpm
pnpm i -g @adonisjs/upgrade-kit
```

```sh
// title: yarn
yarn global add @adonisjs/upgrade-kit
```

:::

## Usage

To use the upgrade kit, you can run the following command.

:::codegroup

```sh
// title: npm
npx @adonisjs/upgrade-kit@latest {patchName} --path=/path/to/your/project
```

```sh
// title: pnpm
pnpm dlx @adonisjs/upgrade-kit@latest {patchName} --path=/path/to/your/project
```

:::

- `{patchName}` should be replaced by the name of one of the patches listed below
- `--path` should be replaced by the path to your project. This is optional, if not provided, the current directory will be used.
